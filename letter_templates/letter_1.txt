Dear [NAME],

A Very Happy Birthday to You!

On this special day, I wanted to take a moment to celebrate not just another year of your life, but also the amazing individual you are. Here's to a year of new opportunities, challenges, and successes.

Wishing You:
- A year filled with health, happiness, and fantastic memories.
- 365 days of code that compiles on the first try.
- Success in every endeavor, be it basketball or coding.

And speaking of code, I've got something you might find interesting. Head over to my GitHub to check it out: https://github.com/YongHsiangHsieh
